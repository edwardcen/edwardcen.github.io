## 01/01/2020

This is the first entry of my new research/life blog, one of my new year resolutions for 2020. I know of many people who have blogging as their new year goals, most of whom stop within a couple of days but hopefully this one will last. My main motivation for this project is that if I force myself to publicly update what I work on day-to-day, I will actually be forced to work on research everyday rather than procrastinate until right before a lab meeting. I also hope to make more polished posts from time to time.
